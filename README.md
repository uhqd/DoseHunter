# DOSE HUNTER


DoseHunter is a stand-alone executable for Varian Eclipse V18.x. (or more) DoseHunter automatically collects dose data (dose max, dose min, D95\%, etc.) for a large number of patients in your database. DoseHunter creates a .csv file with your data that can be easily analyzed with Excel, Python...
It is possible to get data from simple plans, sum plans but not uncertainties plans (since V18.0).

 Please read the [user guide](https://github.com/uhqd/DoseHunter/blob/master/myDoseHunter/Dose%20Hunter%20-%20USERGUIDE.pdf). (also in [french](https://github.com/uhqd/DoseHunter/blob/master/myDoseHunter/Dose_Hunter_User_Guide__french_.pdf))
